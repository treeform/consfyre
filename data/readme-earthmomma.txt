EarthMomma Font
Original font created by Mirz (Michelle Lehmann)
Based on the Mother 3 / Earthbound 2 translation font 

The original translation font was created by many talented
individuals and credit belongs to them.  I'm the author of
this font but not the creator of this modified Earthbound
font design.

Earthbound © Ape, Inc., HAL Laboratory, Inc., and Nintendo.
I am in no way associated or affiliated with any of these
entities.

=====================================

This font is best used at 6pt in most graphic programs.

This font is a replication of the font used on the name
screen in Mother 3. It is a condensed version of the main
font--no letters or symbols go below the baseline. To
replicate the entry characters, some lesser-used characters
in the font has been replaced with pixel graphic characters
featured on the game screen.

This font may be used for personal, non-commercial use only.
